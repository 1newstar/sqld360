Changelog
=========

I suggest to rely on Github for details about code changes, this will only be a macro about "functionalities"
Was supposed to start on day 1, better late than never no? :-)

v1621
=====
1. Added support for Materialized Views under Object and Metadata section
2. Replaced pie charts with bar charts, easier to show differences in size
3. Modified charts to show similar colors to EM when dealing with wait events / wait classes
4. Removed calls to procedure DBMS_STATS.CONVERT_RAW inserting result into the plan_table, replaced with inline calls to functions in UTL_RAW
5. Added Observation on redundant indexes
6. Modified SQL Plan Directives SQL to support DS results stored in SPD (new in 12.2)
7. Added new report under In-Memory section (some new in 12.2)
8. Modified formula for "Elapsed time per .. execution" removing the LEAST(max-min, count) to be just max-min (not sure why it was the other way around)
9. Fixed bug on Partition Statistics History 


v1620
=====
1. Introduced limit (configurable) to number of plans to focus on unde Plan Details page. Plans are selected based on the amount of data we have for each of them
2. Disabled by default the usage of v$object_dependency to build list of tables (too much unnecessary info brought over)
3. Disabled SQL_TRACE for SQLd360 execution itself, never used so why doing it in the first place.
4. Replaced list of tables stored in SQLPlus variable with rows into plan_table, allows to handle long list (SQLPlus variable is max 3k chars)
5. Added USER_ID into from ASH, included in Raw ASH and List of executions from ASH reports
6. Added Raw ASH into to Top SQL executions under Plan Details
7. Added report Average buffer gets per row per execution per Plan Hash Value from AWR, will help spot "bad plans on paper"
8. Minor cosmetic changes
